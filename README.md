# Overview

Simple app that 'battles' two github accounts against each other and presents the winner.

## Motivation

I am learning React.js so I am building small apps like this to understand the framework and how to work with it.

## Installation

You need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

1. Download the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start` and the app will start at `localhost:8080`.
